TODO:

- test for initialization of the network
- test for basic functionality of: 1) SIR calculation 2) Travel motion
- add sanity checks

- run simulations...
- depending on performance parallelaization of SIR calculation per step (maybe different weighting factors between travel times to save time steps?)
